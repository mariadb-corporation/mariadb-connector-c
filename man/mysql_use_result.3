mysql_use_result \- returns an unbuffered result set
.SS Synopsis
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <nysql.h>

MYSQL_RES * mysql_use_result(MYSQL * mysql);
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Description
.PP
Used to initiate the retrieval of a result set from the last query
executed using the mysql_real_query() function on the database
connection.
Either this or the \f[B]mysql_store_result(3)\f[R] function must be
called before the results of a query can be retrieved, and one or the
other must be called to prevent the next query on that database
connection from failing.
.SS Parameters
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]mysql\f[R] is a connection identifier, which was previously
allocated by \f[B]mysql_init(3)\f[R] and connected by
\f[B]mysql_real_connect(3)\f[R].
.SS Notes
.PP
The mysql_use_result() function does not transfer the entire result set.
Hence several functions like \f[B]mysql_num_rows(3)\f[R] or
\f[B]mysql_data_seek(3)\f[R] cannot be used.
mysql_use_result() will block the current connection until all result
sets are retrieved or result set was released by
\f[B]mysql_free_result(3)\f[R].
.SS Return value
.PP
Returns an unbuffered result set or \f[C]NULL\f[R] if an error occurred.
